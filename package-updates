Package Updates

Zzzzz.  Oh.  Sorry.  I fell asleep.

===========
Take updates.
Do it as root (su -s)
apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade; apt-get autoremove
notice that I do it often
history, and its explanation

time apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade; apt-get autoremove
turn it into a script
set EDITOR
which vi
readlink -f



remember to put in a #
write to a file
professionalize: add shebang line, ampersands, indentation, pull out time
note that && and || auto-continue, like for & while
chmod it, add to path
add to the crontab

Summary:
su -s
use the history
how to think about history
develop on the command line, then turn into a script
&& and || let you format nicely
EDITOR acts for all
command_not_found_handle()
readlink -f
+=: adds to path
